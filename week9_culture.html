<!-- Page Header -->
  <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Eoin Can Code</h1>
        <p class="lead">If you are here, you're probably lost.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <!-- Left Hand Column -->
        <div class="col-md-8"> <h3>~ Abstract Random ~</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Imagine, for a second, the shape of a kite. Bunted at one end, elongated at the other, with two equidistent sites to help it sail through the air. This is the shape of my brain, so to speak, with a heavy dominance of abstract randomness and but a pipsqueak of concrete sequentialism to be found (AS & CR both flank in healthy proportions, in case you were wondering).</p>

        <p><a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc's Mind Styles</a> juxtapose my strengths and weaknesses on their axes rather starkly. "Likes using their imagination" - *tick*. "Dislikes working with dictatorial personalities" (does <em>anybody</em> like this?). Bad with rules and routine, but great with empathic or group situations. etc. etc. So no surprises here (except that I apparently don't like competitive situations, with is either a blantant error or I have been lying to myself all these years).</p>

        <p>Looking to the extremes, and also looking at my opposite (Concrete Sequential) I should pose a few disclaimers, according to Anthony Gregorc, Ph.D.<br><br>
          * I may have difficulty accepting criticism (even positive criticism).<br>
          * I may find it challenging to work with people who don't <em>seem</em> friendly.<br>
          * Concentrating on one thing at a time is difficult.</p>

          <p>I'm actually most interested to pair with a Concrete Sequential thinker as I think our differences will make us much stronger as a whole (we can see more angles together, orthagonally speaking). Although I recognize that CS & AR are probably the styles most likely to have difficulty working together <em>so that may take some relationship work.</em></p>

          <p> I am reminded of a great friend of mine from university who was definitely CS - we would drink beer and play chess, and while our game styles couldn't have been more different (I, aggressive and experimental, he, conservative but methodical). On aggregate neither style was better, just different.</p>

          <p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
            I wasn't surprised to get AR, as I do tend to live in my own world sometimes. The balanced CR/AS seems to pan out, although I would have expected CR to be more weighted than it was.

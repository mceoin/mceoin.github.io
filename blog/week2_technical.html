<h2>Question: Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h2>
<p>Answer:<br>

<p>A long, long time ago, around the dawn of the World Wide InterwWebz, code was still forming and Netscape, led by big "Kahunah" Marc Andreesen, was battling with little old Bill (aka, Bill Gates, of Microsoft) and his crappy-ass browser, Internet Explor. </p>

<p>The central issue was that nobody had yet dominated the web, and whichever broswer got mass-adoption would be the one that determined which programming language would prevail (to the victor go the spoils - ya dig?)</p>

<p>Like good versus evil, Marc needed superpowers on his side so had his Magus buddy Brendan Eich code up a storm, to cut Microsoft's lunch by - as we say in the business world - "underdoing the competition". Basically, they copied somebody elses code (a version of Java) but trimmed it down to make it really, really simple so that anybody could code in it, and they made it really light, so it'd be damn fast.  (note: java was the source, but javascript is its own beast now, so they're not to be confused)</p>

<p>But back to Javascript and Netscape... In a stroke of genius, the Netscape team decided that they should stick this programming language and embed it right into the browser, <i> so you could execute code in the browser! </i>.</p>

<p>Long story short, Javascript was so useful that it was really popular, and it made its way into all the other browsers. And now it's the <i> de facto </i> programming language of the web.
<br>
Right place at the right time, I guess.</p>

<p>Anything else? <br>Ah yes, it was written in 12 days, so there's a whole range of problems with it (or so I hear), but if you learn to code in JS then you're gung-ho ready for the interwebs, because it all runs on JS at the end of the day. </p>

<p>Namely, global objects (all objects get thrown in a global variable, or some such. And that has rammifications that I don't fully understand yet.)</p>

<p>Luckily, a book was written called "Javascript, the good parts", which teaches you the rules to writing good code, and if you stick to those, Javascript is survivable, and maybe even exciting.</p>

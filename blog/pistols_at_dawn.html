// pseudocode "pistols at dawn"

//Ask player 1 their name:___
//Use player 1's name to refer to them henceforth.
// ask them to select a pistol (1), a bazooka(2), or a fencing sword(2)
pistol has an x chance of hitting the target, bazooka y, fencing sword z.

//Ask player 2 their name:___
//Use player 2's name to refer to them henceforth.
// ask them to select a pistol, a bazooka, or a fencing sword (must be spelt correctly)
pistol has an x chance of hitting the target, bazooka y, fencing sword z.

// obviously, attach probability to the options assigned.

//randomly roll a "dice" (dice = number) between a range 1-3. 
//If the random number is the same as the person's selection (1, 2 or 3), then they land a "hit". If not, both miss. 

If both hit, both players "win", by which we mean the other person dies, which means both players die. Hazzah!

If both players miss (random number is not the same as either player's number), they can either decide upon "diplomacy" (control + c), or to fight again "enter"


//Both players can chose the same enumber (weapon)
If an error,  something went wrong and the whole thing is called off. 

// To initiatie combat, somebody has to press "enter"

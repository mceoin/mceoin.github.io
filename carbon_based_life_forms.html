            <h2 class="blog-post-title"><em>"Your teachers are the best bipedal carbon-based lifeforms that I could find... and I want you to know feng shui."<br>
	- Karim Bishay</em></h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April, 2014 by <a href="http://twitter.com/mceoin">Eoin</a>
</p>

All aboard the crazy train, a co-creational teaching and learning experience where we're all in this together. The next 9 weeks are one huge EXPERIMENT - and our remaining cognizant of that phrasing gives us permission to deviate and expand and improve upon whatever is being given to us and wherever we find ourselves. We are but padawans, yet even masters can learn from their students. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, what's that smell? It smells like good cooking but we'll have to try it to see if we like it, and if not? No big deal. You can get your own salt if there isn't some at your table - or heck just jump behind the bunsen burner and whip up some treacle for dessert -> try to make some for all of us, because we like eating too. Speaking of salt, did you know that you can make salt? You just have to learn how, and maybe it's worth it (or maybe not?) but the only way to find out is to try it. Most importantly, you'd better come hungry for knowledge (not just salt).
</p>
<p>
Which really brings us to the core of the issue: if someone makes better tiramisu than you, what does that say about you? Have you failed at life in some unutterable truth of inconsequence? Or is it ok, ok, because there will always be someone whose tiramisu is better than yours, and that's ok. Do you know how to make it? Does it taste good? Do you know why it tastes good? Great!
</p>
<p>
As for how you snuck into this kitchen in the first place... the funny thing is that the head chef doesn't care - you're a bipedal life form and you can do it! (and you will do it, it's just going to hurt a lot, to a whole lot more than a lot!).
</p>
<p>
So where are we going with all this anyway? What is success?
<br>
	Scope: Programming School
<br>
	Objective: Learn how to make computers do whatever I [- human -] want them to.
<br>
	Given: you don't know shit, young padawan, but you will...
<br>
	Pretty fungible, huh?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a better way to think of DBC is this. We're learning not what to think, but how to think. Not what to build, but how to build. And mostly to drop this pretence that we know everything and instead to accept that we are emotional creatures who don't know all that much about programming (and still won't even after DBCâ€¦ although we'll know a whole lot more than when we went in) and ultimately the only tool we have at our disposal is ourselves: our brains and the brains of others.
</p>
<p>
Learning Emotional Intelligence makes us better. It just does. So come with a sense of humility, walk in as a child (with a wrench and an apron), stay persistent, remain reflexive, prepare to be frustrated, and whatever you do: stay curious.
<br>
The end.
</p>
<p>
Post-script: The emotional part of DBC scares me more than a little. It's not that I'm not emotional (I'm certainly no automaton) but vulnerability - public vulnerability - is not exactly an aspirational trait taught to Australian males. How much of this is personal vs how much is cultural, we'll never know. So we're entering uncharted waters, and even writing about this in a blog format makes me uncomfortable.

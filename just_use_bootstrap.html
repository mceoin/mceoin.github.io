        <div class="col-md-8"> <h3>Just Use Bootstrap! (A guide, of sorts)</h3>
          
          <br><p><em>"Use HTML/CSS to create a website."</em><br><br>

            <strong>Option 1 -</strong> Take the ascetic route, starting from scratch and building everything from the ground up yourself. If you chose this option I applaud and commend you, because you are the ultimate hipster. I say this not in a pajoritive sense, but because custom HTML/CSS is hard. The masters do it effortlessly and they create whole worlds within the browser.<br><br>

            <em>But I am no master...</em><br><br>

            <strong>Option 2 -</strong> Use a framework. Notably, Bootstrap.</p>

            <p><a href = "http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> (formerly Twitter Bootstrap), is the most popular front-end framework for web development and is in use by a very large number of websites (smaller than a Bignum, but still quite a large number). Unsurprisingly, bootstrap websites run the gamut and range from your stock-standard <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">developer site</a>, to stuff that's <a href="http://www.hydearchitects.com/">way more glitzy</a> - the poing being that bootstrap is a skeleton, and it's still up to you to turn it into a ballerina or an F1 car or whatever else you fancy.</p>

            <p><strong>Templates:</strong> There are plenty of stock-standard templates available from the main Bootstrap website which you can use to get started. They're ok, but I would recommend against them. If you're <em>really</em> in a hurry you can even pay for a fully fledged bootstrap theme for a website, but now you're doing worse than cheating: you're front-loading a world of pain for yourself very soon down the track - everything is interconnected so you'll spend at least as much time going backwards as forwards. As a general rule of thumb, if will ever need to change more than 10% of a template's design (both now and into the future) - build it all yourself (using bootstrap).</p>

            <p>The main advantages of boostrap that I have found are that it is fully mobile responsive from the get-go (big win), it's cleanly written and documented, there are plenty of examples to reference, and it's thoroughly documented with examples on how to do just about eveything: need a dropdown? Copy+Paste the code snippet. Likewise for buttons, menus, sign-in pages, carousels, etc. etc. etc. It also provides support for Less and Sass (CSS preprocessors), although having never used them I can't recommend those just yet.</p>

            <p>The most useful template I found was the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/">Bootstrap grid examples template</a> which you can use as a reference to see how your wireframes will match up with grid-lines in the Bootstrap framework. I recommend looking these grid lines, understanding how they work (bootstrap is based on a 12-across grid column, for example), and squeezing/expanding your browser window to understand how the grid shifts on mobile and tablet devices. Lastly, remember the grid system when wireframing or designing with pen and paper. If you can stick to using a grid at the design phase for desktop, tablet and mobile, then implementation in code will be a much smoother ride.</p>

            <p>And that's how you make a diptyche on the web!</p> 

            <p>[Bonus round: hosting]<br><br>

              While you'll note that I'm still using github pages on my blog, I took a nice detour through the wider world of hosting solutions, notably <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>.<br><br>

              Digital Ocean is a sweet hosting provider that's fairly new on the scene but are impressive in a number of aspects:<br><br>
              * Thorough Documentation. (I set up a mail servers an NGINX proxy using their step-by-step guides)<br>
              * $5/m<br>
              * Remote access (they have a virtual terminal you can use to deploy and mess around with - this might sound small, but one day your site will go down while you're raging at a friend's house, and you may be thankful you can sign in through the browser!).<br><br>
